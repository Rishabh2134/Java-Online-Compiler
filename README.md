# Online-Compiler

Abstract:
In order to run programs, a compiler is required. It translates source code written in text into object code, which is an executable format. If the compiler is set to run manually on every system, it will take up a lot of disc space and, if not installed with default parameters, it will require proper configuration. Most apps and their related interfaces are designed to work online in the modern development environment. As a result, we intend to build an online compiler. The major goal of our compiler is to make it easier for any user to build and run programs written in any language without having to download an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or compiler. No development kit is needed on a client machine.

Problem Statement:
Learning to code could be a challenge for beginner programmers as it requires basic computer knowledge to setup a coding environment by downloading the development kit of a particular programming language, setting up few environment variables, downloading and configuring an IDE and few more. In order to remove this barrier we are creating an Online Compiler where one can directly start to code without doing any initial setup.
